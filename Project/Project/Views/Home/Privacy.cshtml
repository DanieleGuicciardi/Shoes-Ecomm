    <p>Welcome to Scarpe & Co!</p>

    <h2>Personal Data Handling</h2>
    <p>Good news: we don’t collect, store, or process any of your personal data! Why? Because we’re too busy selling awesome tennis shoes, and frankly, handling user data sounds complicated. So rest assured, your information is as safe as a brand-new pair of sneakers—untouched and pristine.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Nope, no cookies here! The only thing we track is how stylish our shoes are. So feel free to browse without worrying about annoying pop-ups or hidden data collection.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Since we don’t store your data, we also don’t share it with anyone. No sneaky third-party deals, no targeted ads—just a simple shoe store doing what it does best.</p>

    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions (though we’re not sure why you would), feel free to reach out. Just know that we won’t have any of your data to refer back to!</p>

    <p>Enjoy shopping at Scarpe & Co!</p>
